# Snake game
Snake is a video game where the player maneuvers a growing line that becomes a primary obstacle to itself.

## My implementation
My version of the game was entirely made with html, css and javascript.

If you want to play the game go to [this website](https://afonsosnake.herokuapp.com).

Hope you enjoy it! 😄

## Download
In case you want to download the files to test the code for yourself you need to rename the '.env.exemple' file to '.env' and set your own database user and password
